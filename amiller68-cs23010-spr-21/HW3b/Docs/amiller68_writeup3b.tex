\subsection{Changes to the design}
The following addresses changes I have made to my projects design, broken down by module:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Top level modules (serial.c and parallel.c)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Algorithm implementation level (chksum.c)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item My original design for both the serial and parallel dispatchers utilized a scheme in which each would repeatedly calculate and check whether they had surpassed the allotted time limit. This incurred no small amount of overhead. 
		\\
		Now, rather than having the dispatching threads calculate time intervals themselves, they both call the new method $start\_timed\_flag()$, which takes in two arguments:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item volatile bool *done : a volatile pointer to a malloced flag
			\item int M : a integer specifying a number of milliseconds
		\end{itemize}
		This method spawns a new thread that sleeps for $M$ milliseconds before setting the value pointed to by $done$ to $true$. The method than detaches the spawned thread and returns.
		\\
		Dispatching sections can then just operate so long as the value pointed to by $done$ if $false$. In $chksum\_serial()$, this value is allocated before the test is run. In $chksum\_parallel$, this value is allocated in the $create\_queue\_pool()$ method and pointed to by all $packet\_queue\_t$ instances in the queue pool.
		\\
		This method does incur the extra overhead of managing an additional thread, which may complicate performance analysis -- %explain why something about numeber of threads not being aligned with clean values%/
	\end{itemize}
	\item Queue data structure (queue.c)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Lock data structure (lock.c)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Testing script (test\_script.sh)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
	\end{itemize}
	\item These changes remain consistent with my previously stated invariants
\end{itemize}
